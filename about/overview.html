  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>An introduction to programming using Python, this course covers reading and writing code, testing, and debugging. It caters to students, regardless of prior programming experience, who want to specifically learn Python. Topics include functions, variables, conditionals, loops, exceptions, and more. Hands-on exercises and real-world problem-solving tasks offer ample practice. No additional software is requiredâ€”just a web browser or your own PC or Mac.</p>

  <p>Whereas CS50x delves into computer science and various languages like C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, CS50P focuses solely on Python programming. You can enroll in CS50P before, during, or after CS50x. However, for a broader introduction to computer science, CS50x is recommended.</p>
